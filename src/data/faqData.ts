    question: "Is Cupping painful?",
    answer:
      "The removal of blood through suction itself is completely painless for all patients. 90% of patients don't feel any pain whatsoever when the scratches are made, but some, depending on their pain threshold, may experience a ticklish sensation, and others may feel what resembles faint paper cuts. Rest assured, the scratches are very light and only designed to pierce the very top layer of the skin. In the hands of an experienced therapist, they are made within just a few seconds.",

    question: "Why am I not seeing any immediate results of the Cupping therapy?",
    answer:
      "A Cupping session will often give immediate pain relief in many parts of the body, especially for lower-back pain, but for other areas it may however take a bit longer. Cupping works in several ways; both as a detoxification of the blood and as a preventative medicine. When working with preventing diseases, the effects of the Cupping will take longer as it attempts to influence and improve the condition as a whole. You may not notice the effects it had on you immediately – although your overall health and immune system is in fact improving, sometimes without you even noticing it.",

    question: "What is the difference between ‘Wet Cupping and ‘Dry Cupping’?",
    answer:`
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li> Dry Cupping - This is the process of using a vacuum on different areas of the body in order to gather the blood in that area without incisions. 70% of diseases, pain or ailments are due to the blood congestion and its inability to reach certain parts of the body. Dry massage cupping allows the blood to reach these places, therefore being a remedy to many ailments that people suffer from.
        </li>
        <li> Wet Cupping - This is the process of using a vacuum on different points of the body but with incisions in order to remove 'harmful' blood which lies just beneath the surface of the skin.

    question: "Will I lose too much blood?",
    answer:
      "One thing you have to understand is that the blood that comes out is from the surface of the skin, it is not from the mainstream. If you are thinking your blood system only contains hemoglobin, platelets, plasma and white blood cells you are wrong, there are so many other junks that fly around in your body such as dead blood cells, blood clots, different toxins and pathogens. Different people’s body gives different responses, sometimes hardly anything comes out from a person’s skin and that is not a bad thing. Because the cuts are very light the body heals the area very quick and automatically the blood stops coming out. We constantly analyze the patient to ensure they are feeling well.",
