      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">What is Hijama (Cupping Therapy)?</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Hijama, also known as cupping therapy, is a traditional healing practice that dates back thousands of years.
        It involves the use of suction cups placed on specific points of the body to draw out stagnant blood, toxins,
        and impurities. This holistic treatment is rooted in prophetic medicine and is widely used to promote physical
        and mental well-being.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        During a Hijama session, sterile cups are applied to the skin to create suction. After a few minutes, small,
        superficial incisions are made, and the cups are reapplied to draw out blood. This process helps improve blood
        circulation, detoxifies the body, and stimulates the immune system.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
